## 🔍 Understanding the Framework

The **playwright-automation-practice** framework is built to help you automate your testing processes. Here are some key components:

- **Playwright**: A powerful automation library that allows you to control browsers with ease.
- **TypeScript**: This will let you interact with the framework in a structured way.
- **Test Runner**: The tool that manages the tests you run.
- **Allure Reports**: Generates reports that show the results of your tests.
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: A design pattern that makes your tests organized and maintainable.

## 👩‍💻 Running Your First Test

To run a test, follow these steps:

1. **Open a Terminal**: 
   - On Windows, you can search for "Command Prompt" or "PowerShell".
   - On macOS, use "Terminal".
